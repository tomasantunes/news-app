I need you to build an app that fetches news from Newsapi.org and displays them on a webpage.

You are going to build the app with Express.js, you are going to make the API requests with Axios and the front-end with JQuery.

In the back-end you need to make axios requests GET requests to the three following URLs:

- https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=XXXXXXXX
- https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=pt&apiKey=XXXXXXXX
- https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=technology&apiKey=XXXXXXXX

From those requests you retrieve response.data.articles which is an array.

On the front-end you create 3 sections for each URL and loop through the arrays. You must create a list of links for each section by grabbing the "title" and "url" keys from each object in the array.
